# Stand Clear of the Closing Gap: Between Physical, Digital, and Human Connection

A wise man (my English teacher) once said that emotion is derived from an inability to act. Year by year, this gap between thought and action grows dangerously thin, thanks to technology.

This scrollytelling site considers our growing entaglement with technology and the especial importance of diversity in cultivating this parallel, digital world.

## Design Process
I sought to capture the movements of physical transit (in this case, driving) in a digital format, fusing the two forms of connection that characterize a modern lifestyle. Analogous shapes and forms between the two, like between traffic lights and window managers, were incorporated to add flow and a spark of creativity to the site.
